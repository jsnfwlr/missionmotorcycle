## Installation

- Install [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
or [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/).
- [Click here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/423038-mission-motorcycle-booking-helper) then click [**Install this script**](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/423038-mission-motorcycle-booking-helper/code/Mission%20Motorcycle%20Booking%20Helper.user.js), then click **Install**:

Once you've successfully logged in to the PDA booking site, this userscript will add the dialog shown in the screenshot, allowing you to automatically check for available time slots that meet your preferred dates and times.

Once you click **Go** the script will continue to check each of the selected centres every 5 minutes until a time slot is found or you click **Stop**.

When a time slot that meets your choices is found, it will be selected and confirmed for you. If multiple time slots are found, the first one that meets your criteria will be booked for you.

Given the poor availability of time slots, it is a good idea to use this script to make an initial booking for any time slot you can get then refine your choices to try and get a better booking.
